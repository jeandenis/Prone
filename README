Prone is a Haskell and Clojurescript framework for making dynamic
websites.  

===

Prone automatically synchronizes models between the server and
clients, allowing changes to be experienced live across by multiple
users.

Server-side, data is encapsulated in Models, which are contained
within and updated through actor-style messages.  Models are json-like
data structures that support dictionaries (map), channels (push-only
queues), arrays, and strings.  Clients have access to parts of a
model, as defined by a view, and automatically receive updates for all
changes to their view.

Updates are synchronized using an actor model (see Actor.hs).

===

Pseudo-code example:

;; assume client-1 and client-2 are actors that communicate
;; with 2 web-clients using the Prone framework

(def m (create-model {:name "Jean-Denis"
                      :a-channel [1 2 3]}))

(def m' (add-view m client-1 {:name true}))

(def m'' (add-view m' client-2 {:name true
                                :a-channel true}))

(def m''' (update-model m'' {:name "Georgia"}))
;; after the above, both client-1 and client-2
;; receive update messages telling them that :name 
;; has changed to "Georgia"

(def m'''' (update-model m''' {:a-channel 4}))
;; after the above, client-2 (only) receives an update
;; message telling it that 4 has been appended to :a-channel
